# Test Calculator in Chai

This repository contains a simple calculator project tested using the Chai assertion library. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in writing unit tests with Chai for potential employers.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Additional functionalities: checking if a number is even, and capitalizing the first letter of a string.
- Unit tests written using the Chai assertion library.

### Prerequisites

- npm init -y
- npm install mocha chai --save-dev

### To run the test

- npm test calucaltor.test.mjs

## 
Quick Note : 
- you can change the numbers in the test file " expect(caluclator.add(10,1)).to.equal(11) to  expect(caluclator.add(10,1)).to.equal(10) and it will fail and not pass the test same goes for the other ones"
